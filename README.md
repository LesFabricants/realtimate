# Realtimate - Local Realm Atlas Environment Simulator

Realtimate is a command-line tool designed to facilitate the simulation of a local environment for MongoDB Realm on Atlas. This tool enables developers to test and debug their applications that utilize MongoDB Realm services without the need to interact with a live Atlas cluster. By creating a localized simulation of the Realm environment, developers can iterate faster, identify issues earlier, and ensure the reliability of their applications.

## Installation

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the Realtimate repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/realtimate.git

   ```
   cd realtimate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies using npm:

4. Build the project:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```
5. Install the CLI globally:

   ```
   npm install -g
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the `realtimate` command to manage and simulate your local Realm Atlas environment.

### Init your project

To start initialization, runÂ :

```
realtimate init
```

This command initializes the project with minimum requirements and allows future deployments to realm atlas

### Create a local realm app

```bash
realtimate new <appName>
```

This will create a local realm app with the good tree. and a `src/<appName>` folder with the .ts files of your functions.

### Run

Finally, to simulate your app, just run

```bash
realtimate run
```

# Realtimate - Local Realm Atlas Environment Simulator

Realtimate is a command-line tool designed to facilitate the simulation of a local environment for MongoDB Realm on Atlas. This tool enables developers to test and debug their applications that utilize MongoDB Realm services without the need to interact with a live Atlas cluster. By creating a localized simulation of the Realm environment, developers can iterate faster, identify issues earlier, and ensure the reliability of their applications.
